* The Wine Quality Prediction project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical features. The dataset includes attributes like acidity, alcohol content, sugar levels, and other factors that influence wine quality. By using machine learning algorithms, the project builds a model to predict the quality of wine, which is rated on a scale. This can help winemakers, sellers, and consumers make better decisions based on the wine's characteristics.
